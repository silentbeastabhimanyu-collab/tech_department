> # 🐍 Python Learning Journey – Silent Beast Abhimanyu

This repository is my step-by-step Python learning record as part of my **Study · Tech · Lift · AI** mission.

## 📘 Concepts Covered
- Print Statements
- Variables
- String Concatenation
- Arithmetic & Assignment Operators
- Comparison Operators
- Membership Operators (`in`, `not in`)

## 💡 Example
```python
string = "Hellow"
print('H' in string)
print('h' in string)

l = [10, 20, 30, 40]
print(50 in l)
print(50 not in l)

## 🧠 Identity Operators in Python | 5th November 2025

### 📄 Code:
```python
x = 10
y = 10
print(x is y, x == y)     # True True

x = 10
y = 10
print(x is not y, x != y) # False False
True True
False False
🧠 Python Bitwise Operators — Logical Power of 0 & 1

Author: Silent Beast Abhimanyu | Study · Tech · Lift · AI · Cyber Security (Evolve Experts)

 Project Overview

This project demonstrates the core logic behind Bitwise Operators in Python — &, |, and ^.
It shows how binary operations reflect real-life principles like discipline, creativity, and balance.

“Life works like bits —
sometimes you need AND (discipline),
sometimes OR (creativity),
and sometimes XOR (balance).”

 Code Example
# Python Bitwise Operator Practice
# Author: Silent Beast Abhimanyu | Study · Tech · Lift · AI · Cyber Security (Evolve Experts)

x = 10
y = 8

print(bin(x))          # Binary representation of x
print(bin(y))          # Binary representation of y

print(x & y, bin(x & y))   # AND Operation
print(x | y, bin(x | y))   # OR Operation
print(x ^ y, bin(x ^ y))   # XOR Operation

 Output
0b1010
0b1000
8 0b1000
10 0b1010
0b10

 Concept Breakdown
Operator	Meaning	Example	Binary Result	Decimal Result
&	Bitwise AND	10 & 8	1000	8
`	`	Bitwise OR	10 | 8	1010
^	Bitwise XOR	10 ^ 8	0010	2

Explanation:

AND (&) returns 1 only if both bits are 1.

OR (|) returns 1 if any one bit is 1.

XOR (^) returns 1 if bits are different.

# Python Data Type Practice — Float, Tuple & Type Checking  
### By Silent Beast Abhimanyu | Study • Tech • Lift • AI • Cyber Security

This project contains my practice files where I explored how Python handles different numeric data types — specifically **float values** and **accidental tuple creation using commas**.

---

## 📘 What I Learned

### ✔ Float Data Type  
Working with decimal numbers like:

```python
b = 10.16
print(b, type(b))  

# Python New Challenge — Number Data Types (int, float & complex)

### By Silent Beast Abhimanyu | Study • Tech • Lift • AI • Cyber Security

This challenge explores how Python handles **integer**, **float**, and **complex** number data types — and how type conversion or operations between them behave during execution.

---

## 📌 Code Practiced

```python
x = 10
print(x, type(x))

y = 3.5
print(y, type(y))

z = x + yj        # This line causes an error
print(z, type(z))
# Python Data Types — Float Practice  
### By Silent Beast Abhimanyu | Study • Tech • Lift • AI • Cyber Security

```python
a = 1 + 2j
print(a, type(a))

b = 1 + 2j
print(b, type(b))

d = 2 + 4j
print(d, type(d))

a = 3 + 9j
print(a, type(a))
(1+2j) <class 'complex'>
(2+4j) <class 'complex'>
(3+9j) <class 'complex'>
