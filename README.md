🧠 Python Bitwise Operators — Logical Power of 0 & 1

Author: Silent Beast Abhimanyu | Study · Tech · Lift · AI · Cyber Security (Evolve Experts)

 Project Overview

This project demonstrates the core logic behind Bitwise Operators in Python — &, |, and ^.
It shows how binary operations reflect real-life principles like discipline, creativity, and balance.

“Life works like bits —
sometimes you need AND (discipline),
sometimes OR (creativity),
and sometimes XOR (balance).”

 Code Example
# Python Bitwise Operator Practice
# Author: Silent Beast Abhimanyu | Study · Tech · Lift · AI · Cyber Security (Evolve Experts)

x = 10
y = 8

print(bin(x))          # Binary representation of x
print(bin(y))          # Binary representation of y

print(x & y, bin(x & y))   # AND Operation
print(x | y, bin(x | y))   # OR Operation
print(x ^ y, bin(x ^ y))   # XOR Operation

 Output
0b1010
0b1000
8 0b1000
10 0b1010
0b10

 Concept Breakdown
Operator	Meaning	Example	Binary Result	Decimal Result
&	Bitwise AND	10 & 8	1000	8
`	`	Bitwise OR	10 | 8	1010
^	Bitwise XOR	10 ^ 8	0010	2

Explanation:

AND (&) returns 1 only if both bits are 1.

OR (|) returns 1 if any one bit is 1.

XOR (^) returns 1 if bits are different.

 What You’ll Learn

Understanding binary numbers in Python.

Visualizing bitwise operations using bin().
